# password-hasher
My personal password creating hasher. This is currently meant to be a solution for my password needs. 

It's a work in progress, but I wanted to start sharing it.
I've put in enough effort so hopefully it's not garbage...

It would be cool to make this in other languages too so that it's more portable.
Maybe a Javascript version?
